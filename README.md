## BY GROUP 1 PHASE 4

Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI): A measure of the typical home value and market changes across a given region and housing type. It reflects the typical value for homes in the 35th to 65th percentile range. ZHVI is available both as a smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure and as a raw measure.

Zillow publishes:

Top-Tier ZHVI: Typical value for homes within the 65th to 95th percentile range for a given region.
Bottom-Tier ZHVI: Typical value for homes within the 5th to 35th percentile range for a given region.
ZHVI for All Single-Family Residences: Typical value for all single-family homes in a given region.
ZHVI for Condos/Co-ops: Typical value for condos and co-ops.
ZHVI by Bedroom Count: Typical values for homes with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5+ bedrooms.
ZHVI per Square Foot: Typical value of all homes per square foot, calculated by dividing the estimated home value by the homeâ€™s square footage.

## Problem Statement
The investment firm has posed a seemingly straightforward question: "What are the top 5 best zip codes for us to invest in?" However, defining "best" involves addressing several layers of complexity. The firm requires a comprehensive analysis that considers:

Profit Margins: Identifying areas with the highest potential for price appreciation.
Risk: Assessing the volatility and stability of the market in each zip code.
Time Horizon: Determining the appropriate period for investment, whether short-term or long-term.
Our challenge is to forecast future real estate prices accurately and synthesize this information to make well-rounded investment recommendations.

## Main Objective
The main objective of this analysis is to identify the top five zip codes for investment by forecasting future real estate prices using time series modeling. This involves assessing potential profit margins, evaluating associated risks, and determining an appropriate investment time horizon to provide well-rounded, data-driven recommendations to the real estate investment firm.
